### rough

i guess using INT_MAX or INT_MIN is not a good idea here cuz i think they are a type of long long 

or is might just be a idot which is more probable but it is wot it is 

# Approach 1:

Yup the above worked

reason for this

``` c++
    int LOW_LIM = -(pow(2, 31) / 10);
    int HIGH_LIM = (pow(2, 31) - 1 )/ 10;
```

is

if a * 10 will cause overflow then we put a check before that only 
ye nothing special.

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        
        int LOW_LIM = -(pow(2, 31) / 10);
        int HIGH_LIM = (pow(2, 31) - 1 )/ 10;
        
        int sol = 0;
        
        while(x) {
    
            
            if( sol >= LOW_LIM && sol <= HIGH_LIM){
                
                sol = sol*10 + x%10;
                x /= 10;
            }else{

                return 0;
            }
        }
        
        return sol;
    }
};

```
